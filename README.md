# Hi. Salut. வணக்கம்.
I am a freelance software developer and I interned at Microsoft in the summer of 2019. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from NITK Surathkal and I am looking to pursue a career in research and development. I am passionate about design and design philosophy and I'm looking forward to opportunities that would help me gain new perspectives. Check out my portfolio and blog at [pungav.guru](pungav.guru).
